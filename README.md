In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting  federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial datas of top enron executives.

Here, we are performing some unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model on the dataset to analyze the results obtained from it.
